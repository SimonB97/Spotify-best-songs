"taxonomicAuthority","Name(s) of the author(s) who published the original description of the taxon.","If a taxon’s name or placement has been changed since the original description, the original authority's name is placed in parentheses. For animals, the authority’s names(s) are followed by the year the original description was published. For animal subspecies, only one authority name appears: for nominate subspecies (i.e. the subspecies name matches the species name), the authority for the species description is used; for other subspecies, the authority is the name and year for the description of that subspecies. For plants, the author(s) name(s) are often abbreviated and the year of original publication is not included; if taxonomic changes are made for plants, the original author(s) name(s) are placed in brackets and the author(s) responsible for the altered name are added outside of the brackets. For plant subspecies and varieties, the authors of both the species-level and subspecies/variety-level descriptions are cited. ","","text(60)"
